# Operating Systems Assignment 1

## Introduction

This programming assignment focuses on interacting with Github Classroom, and writing a simple program to validate your development configuration.

This assignment will be graded out of 25 points.

## Instructions
### Configure your development environment
Follow the guidelines in the [Programming Assignment Setup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHtKhu-f2EiWcJhHt3aGLr5e0bN1lyeKXfYha4J3WK8/edit?usp=sharing) document to configure your development environment.
### Accept the assignment
Click on the [Github Classroom Assignment Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/vrDn6eVV) to accept the first assignment. This will create a git repository containing the following files:
* `README.md` - this README file
* `Makefile` - the Makefile that will be used to build the program
* `hello_world.cpp` - a starter file to use to implement your code
* `submit.txt` - the file that will be submitted to Blackboard to officially "turn in" your assignment
* `.vscode` - A directory containing VSCode configuration files appropriate to the assignment, including
  *  `tasks.json` - Defines the rule used to build the program using the Makefile
  *  `launch.json` - Configuration allowing you to run the program from VSCode

Your github repository will be found at http://github.com/skamens-fordham-org/os-hw1-<your_github_username>.
### Clone the github repository to your Linux environment
Log in to the Linux system you will use for development - this could be `erdos` or the WSL installation of Linux on your Windows 10 machine.

Use the following command to clone your repository to your local environment:

```
git clone http://github.com/skamens-fordham-org/os-hw1-<your_github_username>
```

*Note:* In addition to creating your repository, accepting the assignment will also create a "Feedback" pull request. Please _do not_ close or delete this pull request. It will be used for me to communicate comments about your assignment to you. 

### (VSCode Users Only) Add the folder to VSCode
If you are using VSCode to perform your development, run VSCode, enable Remote-WSL access, and choose "File -> Open Folder", selecting your cloned assignment folder.

### Write your program
Follow the instructions in `hello_world.cpp` to write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

### Build your program (C++)
#### Direct shell access
If you are running on `erdos` or working directly in your WSL instance, build the program by changing to your local source directory and typing "make". 

You should see the following output:
```
$ make
g++  -g -I.  -c -o hello_world.o hello_world.cpp
g++ -o hello_world hello_world.o
```
#### VSCode
If you are using VSCode, you can execute the build task by typing `Ctrl-Shift-B` (which maps to "Run Default Build Task"). 

You will see the build output above in the TERMINAL output tab.

### Run your program
Run your program to verify that it prints "Hello, World!" as expected:

#### Direct shell access
```
$ ./hello_world
Hello, World!
$
```
#### VSCode
Run the program by entering "Ctrl-F5" (which maps to "Run -> Run Without Debugging"). Note that the configuration needed to run the program is found in the `.vscode/launch.json` file included in this repository.

You will see the output from the run in the TERMINAL output tab.

### Debugging
You may wish to experiment with the debugger, if you haven't used it before. For command-line users, the debugger is "gdb". In VSCode you can start the debugger using Run -> Debug (F5). 

### Commit your code in git

```
$ git add -A # This stages all changed files
$ git commit
[main 460b567] test
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
```

### Push your code to Github

```
skamens@Sam:~/test-assignment-skamens-fordham$ git push

In VSCode you can use the built-in git tools to commit and push without using the command line.

### Submit your assignment to Blackboard
In order to match your assignment to the grading system, each assignment must be "submitted" in Blackboard. This indicates to me that you consider your assignment ready to be graded. In addition, you will be able to see the detailed rubric for each assignment after grading is complete.

#### Fill in the submission file
Fill in the information in the file `submit.txt`. The contents of the file are as follows:

```
Operating Systems, Spring 2023
Assignment 1

Please fill in the information below and submit this file to Blackboard to turn in your assignment.

#### Upload the file to Blackboard
Click on the [Assignment Link](https://fordham.blackboard.com/ultra/courses/_6168887_1/outline/assessment/test/_4906089_1?courseId=_6168887_1&gradeitemView=details)

#### Click "Browse Local Files"

Select and upload your `submit.txt` file, and click `Submit` (at the bottom of the screen)
